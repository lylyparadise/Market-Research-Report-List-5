<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Fire Alarm And Detection Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Conventional Fire Detection and Alarm Systems</li><li>Addressable Fire Detection and Alarm Systems</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Conventional Fire Detection and Alarm Systems operate on a zone-based system where groups of devices are connected to a control panel. When a device detects smoke or heat, the panel identifies the specific zone. Addressable Fire Detection and Alarm Systems use individual devices with unique addresses connected to a control panel. When a device detects a fire, it communicates its precise location to the panel. Addressable systems are more advanced and provide more detailed information than conventional systems, leading to faster response times and reduced false alarms.</p></p>
