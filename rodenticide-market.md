<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Rodenticide Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Anticoagulants Rodenticides</li><li>Non-anticoagulants Rodenticides</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The rodenticide market is primarily divided into two types: anticoagulants and non-anticoagulants. Anticoagulant rodenticides function by disrupting the blood-clotting process in rodents, leading to death over several days after ingestion. Commonly used in residential and agricultural settings, they are effective for long-term control. Non-anticoagulant rodenticides, on the other hand, act more quickly, often resulting in immediate death. These are typically used in situations requiring rapid rodent population management, such as food processing plants and warehouses.</p></p>
