<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Sodium Hyaluronate (HA) for Ophthalmology Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>BiologicalExtraction</li><li>Ferment</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Sodium Hyaluronate (HA) in ophthalmology is primarily sourced through two methods: biological extraction and fermentation. Biological extraction involves isolating HA from natural sources, typically avian or bacterial tissues, ensuring high purity and biocompatibility for applications like eye drops and surgical aids. Conversely, fermentation utilizes microbial processes to produce HA, offering a more sustainable and scalable production method. Both types serve vital roles in maintaining ocular surface hydration, promoting healing, and providing lubrication during surgical procedures or for treating dry eye conditions.</p></p>
