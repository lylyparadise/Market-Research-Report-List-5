<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Wheatstone Bridge Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Balanced Bridge</li><li>Unbalanced Bridge</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Wheatstone Bridge is an electrical circuit used to measure unknown resistances. In a balanced bridge market, the ratios of resistances are equal, resulting in no current flow through the galvanometer, indicating equilibrium. This configuration is used for precise measurements. Conversely, in an unbalanced bridge market, the resistance ratios differ, causing a current flow, which signifies a discrepancy. This setup is employed for detecting changes in resistance or faults, as it highlights variations in an electrical network.</p></p>
