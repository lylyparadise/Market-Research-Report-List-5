<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Electrodialysis Systems and Equipment Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Continuous Electrodialysis</li><li>Batch Electrodialysis</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Electrodialysis systems and equipment are used for separating ions and molecules from solutions. Continuous electrodialysis involves the continuous operation of the system for large-scale continuous separations. On the other hand, batch electrodialysis involves a cyclic operation where the separation process is stopped and restarted periodically. Continuous electrodialysis is preferred for continuous and high-volume separations, while batch electrodialysis is suitable for smaller-scale separations and when periodic operation is sufficient. Both types cater to different needs in various industries.</p></p>
