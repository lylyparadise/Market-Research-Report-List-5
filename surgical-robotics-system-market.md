<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Surgical Robotics System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Open Surgery</li><li>Minimal Invasive</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The surgical robotics system market is divided into two primary types: open surgery and minimally invasive surgery. Open surgery involves larger incisions and greater physical manipulation of tissues, offering direct access to the surgical site but often resulting in longer recovery times. Conversely, minimally invasive surgery employs robotic systems to perform procedures through small incisions with enhanced precision, leading to reduced trauma, shorter recovery periods, and decreased postoperative pain. Both approaches leverage robotic technology to improve surgical outcomes and patient safety.</p></p>
