<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Urinary Self-Catheter Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Foley Catheters</li><li>Intermittent Catheters</li><li>External Catheters</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The urinary self-catheter market comprises three main types: Foley catheters, intermittent catheters, and external catheters. Foley catheters are continuously indwelling devices used for long-term drainage. Intermittent catheters are inserted as needed for periodic urine drainage, promoting self-management and reducing infection risks. External catheters, often referred to as condom catheters, are non-invasive devices applied externally to the male urethra, providing a convenient option for urine collection without the need for insertion. Each type serves specific patient needs and preferences.</p></p>
