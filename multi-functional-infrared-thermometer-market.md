<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Multi functional Infrared Thermometer Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Contact Infrared Thermometer</li><li>Non-contact Infrared Thermometer</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The multifunctional infrared thermometer market comprises two primary types: contact and non-contact infrared thermometers. Contact infrared thermometers require direct contact with the object to measure temperature, providing accurate readings but potentially affecting the object's surface. In contrast, non-contact infrared thermometers measure temperature from a distance by detecting infrared radiation emitted from the surface. This type is ideal for measuring high-temperature objects or in situations where contamination is a concern, making both types valuable in various applications across industries.</p></p>
