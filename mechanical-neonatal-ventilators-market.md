<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Mechanical Neonatal Ventilators Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Invasive Ventilators</li><li>Non-Invasive Ventilators</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Mechanical Neonatal Ventilators market is divided into two main types: invasive and non-invasive ventilators. Invasive ventilators involve the placement of an endotracheal tube to deliver respiratory support directly into the lungs, making them suitable for critically ill neonates requiring precise ventilation control. Non-invasive ventilators, on the other hand, provide respiratory support through a mask or nasal interface, allowing for easier application and reducing the risk of complications. Both types are essential in addressing neonatal respiratory challenges effectively.</p></p>
