<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Metal Biliary Stent Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Covered Metal Biliary Stent</li><li>Uncovered Metal Biliary Stent</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The metal biliary stent market is categorized into two main types: covered and uncovered stents. Covered metal biliary stents are designed with a protective coating, reducing tissue ingrowth and associated complications, making them ideal for long-term use. Uncovered metal biliary stents, on the other hand, lack this coating, allowing for tissue integration and providing better anchorage but higher risks of occlusion. Both types serve to maintain biliary duct patency, addressing conditions such as bile duct obstructions.</p></p>
