<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Noninvasive Mechanical Ventilation Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Positive-pressure Ventilation</li><li>Negative-pressure Ventilation</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The noninvasive mechanical ventilation market includes two primary types: positive-pressure ventilation and negative-pressure ventilation. Positive-pressure ventilation, commonly utilized in settings like hospitals and at home, ensures air is pushed into the lungs, aiding patients with respiratory challenges such as COPD or sleep apnea. In contrast, negative-pressure ventilation operates externally, creating a vacuum-like environment to facilitate natural lung expansion, often used for patients with neuromuscular disorders. Both types enhance respiratory function while minimizing invasive procedures.</p></p>
