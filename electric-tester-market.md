<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Electric Tester Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Contact-type</li><li>Contactless</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The electric tester market is divided into two main types: contact-type and contactless testers. Contact-type testers require physical contact with the electrical conductor to measure voltage, current, or continuity, providing precise readings. In contrast, contactless testers, such as non-contact voltage testers, detect electric fields around live wires without direct contact, offering safety and convenience. Both types cater to different user needs, with contact-type testers preferred for accuracy, while contactless testers are favored for quick checks and enhancing safety during inspections.</p></p>
